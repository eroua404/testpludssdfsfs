Tasty Recipes is the easiest way to publish recipes on your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Tasty Recipes makes it possible for anyone to publish their favorite recipes to the world. Your recipes will automatically be optimized for search engines and match your theme's design.

= Optimized for humans and machines =

In the WordPress editor, embed a recipe into your post, page or custom post type by using the "Add Recipe" button. When the recipe is inserted into the content, you'll see a preview of the rendered recipe so you know exactly what it's going to look like when published.

On the frontend of your website, your published recipe uses standard markup to fit in naturally with the design of your theme. Readers can click the "Print" button to open a version of the recipe formatted specifically for print.

= Schema.org microdata and JSON+LD =

Tasty Recipes automatically includes Schema.org microdata and JSON+LD to make it easy for Google and other search engines to read your recipes. When entering in your recipe's ingredients or instructions, make sure to create an ordered or unordered list. The list will signal to Tasty Recipes that these items should be marked up with Schema.org microdata and JSON+LD.

= Pain-free switching from EasyRecipe =

EasyRecipe user? Tasty Recipes can fully convert your existing EasyRecipe recipes into the Tasty Recipes format. First, perform a couple of test conversions on existing posts. If your posts support revisions, Tasty Recipes creates new revisions so you can safely roll back to the EasyRecipe markup. Once you've verified your recipes convert as expected, use the batch conversion tool in "Settings" -> "Tasty Recipes" to migrate any remaining existing EasyRecipe recipes.

== Installation ==

The Tasty Recipes plugin can be installed much like any other WordPress plugin.

1. Upload the plugin ZIP archive file via "Plugins" -> "Add New" in the WordPress admin, or extract the files and upload them via FTP.
2. Activate the Tasty Recipes plugin through the "Plugins" list in the WordPress admin.

With Tasty Recipes, there aren't any confusing settings to configure or customizations you need to worry about. You can now share your favorite recipes with the world!
